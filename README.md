# SidePage

**SidePage** is an AI-powered e-reader platform. Users can upload PDF books, which are stored securely using Amazon S3 and listed on a landing page. This marks the foundational phase of the app, setting up core infrastructure for future reading and AI explanation features.

## Inspiration

This project was inspired by the *No Fear Shakespeare* reading companion series and the desire to make complex texts more accessible. The goal is to combine personal reading with AI-powered explanations and critical thinking prompts in a clean, user-friendly reading environment.
